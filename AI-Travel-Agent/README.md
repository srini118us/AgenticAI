# AI Travel Agent

This project demonstrates two approaches to building an AI-powered travel planning assistant:
- A **fixed workflow** (hardcoded pipeline)
- A **flexible ReAct agent** (dynamic, LLM-driven tool use)

## Project Structure

- `AI_Travel_Agent_Starter.ipynb` ‚Äî Notebook with a fixed, hardcoded workflow
- `AI_Travel_Agent_ReAct.ipynb` ‚Äî Notebook with a flexible ReAct agent
- `requirements.txt` ‚Äî Python dependencies

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/srini118us/AgenticAI.git
   cd AgenticAI/AI-Travel-Agent
   ```
2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows (PowerShell):
   venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   # On Mac/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Set up your `.env` file** with your API keys (see sample in the repo).

## How to Run

- **Streamlit App:**
  ```bash
  streamlit run main.py
  ```
- **Jupyter Notebooks:**
  - Open `AI_Travel_Agent_Starter.ipynb` or `AI_Travel_Agent_ReAct.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code and run the cells.

## Approaches: Fixed Workflow vs. ReAct Agent

| Feature/Aspect         | Fixed Workflow (`AI_Travel_Agent_Starter.ipynb`) | Flexible ReAct Agent (`AI_Travel_Agent_ReAct.ipynb`) |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Workflow type          | Hardcoded, fixed sequence                        | Dynamic, agentic, LLM-driven                         |
| Tool/step selection    | Predefined order                                 | Chosen by agent at runtime                           |
| Flexibility            | Low                                              | High                                                 |
| User prompt            | Parameterized                                    | Free-form, conversational                            |
| Use case               | Pipelines, reproducibility                       | Conversational AI, flexibility                       |
| Visualization          | Static workflow graph (LangGraph, Mermaid)       | No fixed graph, but can log steps                    |

### Example: Fixed Workflow
```python
result = plan_trip("Rome", 4, 800)
print(result)
```

### Example: ReAct Agent
```python
prompt = """
I want to visit Rome for 4 days with a focus on history, art, and food.\nMy budget is 800 EUR. Please provide weather, attractions, hotels, and a daily itinerary.
"""
response = agent.invoke({"input": prompt})
print(response)
```

## Example Prompts
- "Plan a 3-day trip to Paris for two people with a $1000 budget. Include weather, top attractions, hotel suggestions, and a daily itinerary."
- "I want to visit Rome for 4 days with a focus on history, art, and food. My budget is 800 EUR. Please provide weather, attractions, hotels, and a daily itinerary."

## Workflow Visualization
- The fixed workflow notebook uses LangGraph and Mermaid to visualize the pipeline.
- The ReAct agent does not have a fixed workflow graph; instead, you can see the agent's reasoning and tool usage in the verbose output.

## Notes
- Make sure your API keys are set up in your `.env` file.
- The project is modular and easy to extend with new tools or features.
- For any issues, please open an issue or contact the maintainer.

## Sample User Prompt

```
I want to visit Rome for 4 days with a focus on history, art, and food.
My budget is 800 EUR. Please provide:
- Weather forecast

- Best local restaurants for Italian cuisine
- Hotel options near major attractions
- A day-by-day itinerary
- Estimated daily and total costs in EUR
- Tips for getting around the city
